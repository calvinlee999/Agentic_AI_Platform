# Lens 2: Data & Lakehouse Engineering

## Overview

The Data & Lakehouse Engineering lens explores how AI agents transform data engineering, from ingestion and transformation to analytics and governance. This module covers modern lakehouse architectures, streaming data platforms, and agent-driven data operations.

## Core Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **AWS Data Services** | Cloud data platform | S3, Glue, Athena, EMR, Redshift |
| **Kafka/MSK** | Streaming platform | Real-time data pipelines |
| **Databricks** | Unified analytics | Lakehouse architecture, Delta Lake |
| **Snowflake** | Cloud data warehouse | Data warehousing, sharing |
| **Claude Agentic SDK** | AI orchestration | Agent-driven data operations |
| **LangChain** | Agent framework | Data pipeline orchestration |
| **SDD (Spec-Driven Development)** | Methodology | Data specs as code |
| **MCP for Data** | Integration standard | Data source connectivity |
| **MCP Marketplace** | Ecosystem | AWS, Databricks, Snowflake MCPs |
