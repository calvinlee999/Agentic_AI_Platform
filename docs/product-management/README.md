# Product Management Module

## Overview

The Product Management module provides a comprehensive framework for integrating AI-driven development practices into product strategy, design thinking, and cross-functional collaboration. This module bridges business requirements with technical implementation through structured methodologies and modern tooling.

## Core Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Design Thinking** | Human-centered innovation | User research, ideation, prototyping |
| **Figma MCP** | Design-to-development bridge | Visual specs, design system access |
| **Angular/React** | Frontend frameworks | Component-based UI development |
| **Java/.NET** | Backend platforms | Enterprise application development |
| **Claude Agentic SDK** | AI orchestration | Agent-driven workflows |
| **LangChain** | Agent framework | Multi-agent orchestration |
| **SDD (Spec-Driven Development)** | Methodology | Requirements as executable artifacts |
| **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** | Integration standard | Universal tool connectivity |
| **MCP Marketplace** | Ecosystem | Enterprise tool integrations |
