| **Amazon Q Developer** | AWS-native agent | Cloud development assistance |
| **Claude Agentic SDK** | AI orchestration | Tool use, multi-step reasoning |
| **LangChain/LangGraph** | Agent framework | Workflow orchestration, state mgmt |
| **crewAI** | Multi-agent platform | Collaborative agent teams |
| **AutoGen** | Agent framework | Conversational agents |
| **SDD (Spec-Driven Development)** | Methodology | AI-executable specifications |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | Integration standard | Universal tool connectivity |
| **MCP Marketplace** | Ecosystem | 30+ enterprise tool integrations |
| **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** | Communication protocol | Inter-agent collaboration |
