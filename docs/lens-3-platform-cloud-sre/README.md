# Lens 3: Platform, Cloud & Site Reliability Engineering

## Overview

The Platform, Cloud & SRE lens covers the infrastructure, automation, and operational excellence required for enterprise-grade agentic systems. This module explores cloud-native architectures, Kubernetes orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, and autonomous remediation patterns.

## Core Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **AWS Cloud** | Cloud infrastructure | Compute, networking, security |
| **Kubernetes** | Container orchestration | Application deployment, scaling |
| **CI/CD Pipelines** | Automation | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins |
| **CloudWatch** | Observability | Metrics, logs, traces, alarms |
| **Infrastructure-as-Code** | Config management | Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK |
| **Claude Agentic SDK** | AI orchestration | Autonomous operations |
| **LangChain** | Agent framework | Multi-agent SRE workflows |
| **SDD (Spec-Driven Development)** | Methodology | Infrastructure specs as code |
| **MCP for Operations** | Integration standard | Cloud service connectivity |
| **MCP Marketplace** | Ecosystem | AWS, Kubernetes, monitoring MCPs |
